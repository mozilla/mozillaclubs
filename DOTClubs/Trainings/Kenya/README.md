# Mozilla DOT Club Leader Training March 2017

## Background
A description of the benefits of the Mozilla Clubs initiative and why Clubs are an integral component of the DOT Digital Champion program. 

### Build Digital Literacy In Your Community Through Mozilla Clubs
Create local solutions and join a global movement. As a Mozilla Club leader you can create the impact that helps build the global Web Literate community. Mozilla Clubs are designed to meet the specific needs of your community and help you make a lasting impact in the lives of club participants. Leading a Mozilla Club enables you to build your web literacy skills and apply them to the challenges and opportunities in your community. This experience will strengthen your community impact resume and provide insight into more sustainable social innovation projects.

### Mozilla Clubs is a model for local, in-person learning
A Mozilla Club brings people together locally to explore, participate in and create the open web in an engaging and collaborative way. They are groups that meet regularly and host events or meet-ups where creativity, collaboration, teaching and learning come together with one objective: developing digital skills.

There are currently 350+ registered Clubs that span 48+ countries. Mozilla Clubs Captains have the opportunity to join several digital channels that help them connect to each other and share experiences. This includes a Facebook group with 850+ participants, a learning forum with 80+ topic threads, a monthly Club Leaders Call with featured guests and an event gallery (note: these links are spelled out in resources section).

### Who participates in clubs?
<strong>Club Captains:</strong> Mozilla Club Captains are drawn from a global community of leaders that cultivate web literacy experiences using high-quality, participatory curriculum. They develop their leadership skills, grow their professional network, receive mentorship and empower people worldwide to be informed contributors and creators of the digital world. DOT youth leaders participating in the Digital Champion pathway are provided the opportunity to be a Mozilla Club Captain. There are two roles for every Club Captain. Depending on their own experience some of our Captains see themselves as facilitators, who are directly teaching the Web to Club members. And some others describe their role more as an organizer, who makes sure things are in place to create a collaborative learning experience, rather than a being a teacher.

<strong>Club Learners:</strong> Community members that have specific ICT capacity development needs who participate in clubs to learn how to explore, participate and create the Web using inclusive and participatory methods. Participants are empowered through authentic making, reflective learning, and meaningful action with and on the Web that is linked to their needs and goals. 

### How will Clubs benefit your community?
Clubs provide a way for community members with similar interests and needs to come together to share knowledge and learn new skills. They foster a safe, collaborative and equal opportunity environment for people of all ages and backgrounds. Mozilla Clubs have access to a collection of digital literacy activities that can be used in online and offline environments. These activities link to a Web Literacy map which outlines specific skills and competencies that are needed to be Web literate. Each Mozilla Club has the ability to connect to a large network of Clubs around the world to further connect and grow their network. 

### How will Clubs benefit you?
Clubs provide young leaders the opportunity to be a part of an open web movement that is spreading digital literacy to new people and communities everywhere. Club participants have access to free tools, resources and curriculum. Through mentorship and trainings they are able to simultaneously build and practice new facilitation skills. Club participants also help test existing curriculum and author new curriculum that is used by a global audience.

Club participants have the opportunity to feature their work at Mozilla events, on community calls and in workshops. They can collaborate with other Club participants through digital platforms and virtual convenings. Other incentives include recognition letters and certificates of completion.

### Why Mozilla Clubs?
Mozilla Clubs are quickly growing in size and impact. It was launched in 2015 and has been very successful in such a short time. Clubs provide an easy and customizable starting point for people of all backgrounds to engage with the Open Web movement.  They create a way for Club Captains to build their own web literacy skills while building relationships with others through sharing those skills. Clubs also help DOT Youth Leaders grow as a DOT Digital Champion and contribute to keeping the internet healthy and prosperous. 

Clubs are key nodes in the Mozilla Leadership Network, which enables connections to other people teaching digital literacy across Mozilla. By connecting with others, individual Clubs have access to best practices and mentorship around the world. 

### Where will you run your club?
Clubs can take place in a variety of places. Deciding where to hold Club gatherings is entirely up to the Club Captain and can be influenced by the needs of the Club learners. Clubs can also move around to different locations if needed. Some common places that Clubs meet are community centers, classrooms, libraries, internet cafes and innovation centers. 

### Community Impact
Clubs are intended to be safe, inclusive and engaging environments that can be customized to fit the needs of the Club learners. Each club is different in location, interest and size, which makes it a very unique initiative with very unique needs, contributors and outcomes. Club Captains are encouraged to choose activities and goals based on the needs of participants. Your success will impact the DOT Digital Champion Program by leveraging the existing Clubs network to deliver digital literacy and use of online services in communities. 

### Clubs will help Digital Champions 
As a Digital Champion, your goal is to help transform your community through promotion of digital literacy skills development. The Mozilla Clubs initiative can help you do that. In most cases Digital Champions will take on the role of Club Captain and/or help identify leaders in the community who can take on the role of Club Captain. Each Captain will develop a plan for their Club that includes a timeline, content areas, goals and more. 

The Club may be used as a launchpad for your community project that is tied to your work as a Digital Champion with DOT. This can happen through the activities and outcomes of each Club gathering. 

### You have an impact on Mozilla’s Trajectory
You are a key voice in shaping the open web and Mozilla relies on voices like yours to play a part in shaping our work and the open web movement. We encourage all Club participants to inject their own needs and ideas into the development of our materials and platforms. There are many opportunities to reflect on Mozilla Clubs initiatives and we hope you share those reflections with us frequently.
